## About

I've created website for weather forecast search. OpenWeatherMap API was used in this project. DOM manipulation\
and data fetching was made via vanilla JavaScript.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Setup
All you need is just a web browser and internet access.

## Gained knowledge
* Basic DOM manipulation via JavaScript:
  * Targeting nodes and its properties and methods
  * Using events for dynamic changes
  * Catching user input value

## Status
Project is: _finished_, but may be improved with 5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast. I'm planning to make the same project\
with React just to feel the difference among vanilla JavaScript and React.
